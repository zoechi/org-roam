@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Org-roam is a @uref{https://roamresearch.com/, Roam Research} replica built around the
all-powerful @uref{https://orgmode.org/, Org-mode}.

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy. Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution
for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

To understand more about Roam, a collection of links are available in
@ref{Note-taking Workflows}.

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

@table @asis
@item Privacy and Security
Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG@.
@item Longevity of Plain Text
Unlike web solutions like Roam research, the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files -- Org-roam simply builds up an auxilliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken down. Edit your plain-text notes in notepad if all other editors cease to exist
@item Free and Open Source
Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam, or open a PR@.
@item Leverages the Org-mode ecosystem
Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
@item Built on Emacs
Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we can inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages available to Emacs.
@end table

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Org-roam can be installed using Emacs' package manager or manually from its development repository.

@menu

* Installing from the Git Repository::
* Post-Installation Tasks::
@end menu

@node Installing from MELPA
@section Installing from MELPA

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven't used Emacs' package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see info:emacs#Packages. Then, add one of the archives to @samp{package-archives}:

@itemize
@item
To use Melpa:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
@end lisp

@itemize
@item
To use Melpa-Stable:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
@end lisp

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

@example
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
@end example

Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its dependencies
using:

@example
M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
@end example

Now see @ref{Post-Installation Tasks}.

@node Getting Started
@chapter Getting Started

This short tutorial describes the essential commands used in Org-roam, to help
you get started.

First, it is important to understand how Org-roam was designed. Org-roam was
built to support a workflow that was not possible with vanilla Org-mode. This
flow is modelled after the @uref{https://zettelkasten.de/, Zettelkasten Method}, and many of @uref{https://roamresearch.com, Roam Research's}
workflows. Org-roam does not magically make note-taking better -- this often
requires a radical change in your current note-taking workflow. To understand
more about the methods and madness, see @ref{Note-taking Workflows}.

To begin using Org-roam, one should set the @samp{org-roam-directory} to the directory
containing your notes. For this tutorial, create an empty directory, and set the
@samp{org-roam-directory}:

@lisp
(make-directory "~/org-roam")
(setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")
@end lisp

We encourage using a flat hierarchy for storing notes, but some prefer using
folders for storing specific kinds of notes (e.g. websites, papers). This is
fine; Org-roam searches recursively within @samp{org-roam-directory} for any notes.
Instead of relying on the file hierarchy for any form of categorization, we
solely rely on links between files to establish connections between notes.

Next, we need to enable the global minor mode @samp{org-roam-mode}. This sets up Emacs
with several hooks, builds a cache and keeps it consistent. We recommend
starting @samp{org-roam-mode} on startup:

@lisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)
@end lisp

To build the cache manually, one can run @samp{M-x org-roam-db-build-cache}. The cache
is a sqlite database named @samp{org-roam.db}, which defaults to residing in the root
@samp{org-roam-directory}. Cache builds may take a while the first time, but is often
instantaneous in subsequent runs.

Let us now create our first note. Call @samp{M-x org-roam-find-file}. This shows a list
of titles for notes that reside in @samp{org-roam-directory}. It should show nothing
right now, since there are no notes in the directory. Entering the title of the
note you wish to create, and pressing @samp{RET} should begin the note creation
process. This process uses @samp{org-capture}'s templating system, and can be freely
customized (see @ref{The Templating System}). Using the default template, pressing @samp{C-c
C-c} finishes the note capture. Running @samp{M-x org-roam-find-file} again should show
the note you have created, and selecting that entry will bring you to that note.

The crux of Org-roam is making it easy to create notes, and link them together.
To link notes together, we call @samp{M-x org-roam-insert}. This brings up a prompt
with a list of title for existing notes. Selecting an existing entry will create
and insert a link to the current file. Entering a non-existent title will create
a new note with that title. Good usage of Org-roam requires liberally linking
files: this facilitates building up a dense knowledge graph of inter-connected
notes.

Org-roam provides an interface to view backlinks. It shows backlinks for the
currently active Org-roam note, along with some surrounding context. To toggle
the visibility of this buffer, call @samp{M-x org-roam}.

For a visual representation of the notes and their connections, Org-roam also
provides graphing capabilities, using Graphviz. It generates graphs with notes
as nodes, and links between them as edges. The generated graph can be used to
navigate to the files, but this requires some additional setup (see @ref{Roam Protocol, , Roam
Protocol}).

@node Anatomy of an Org-roam File
@chapter Anatomy of an Org-roam File

The bulk of Org-roam's functionality is built on top of vanilla
Org-mode. However, to support additional functionality, Org-roam adds
several Org-roam-specific keywords. These functionality are not crucial
to effective use of Org-roam.

@menu
* File Aliases::
* File Refs::
@end menu

@node File Aliases
@section File Aliases

Suppose you want a note to be referred to by different names (e.g.
``World War 2'', ``WWII''). You may specify such aliases using the
@samp{#+ROAM_ALIAS} attribute:

@example
#+TITLE: World War 2
#+ROAM_ALIAS: "WWII" "World War II"
@end example

@node File Refs
@section File Refs

Refs are unique identifiers for files. Each note can only have 1 ref.
For example, a note for a website may contain a ref:

@example
#+TITLE: Google
#+ROAM_KEY: https://www.google.com/
@end example

These keys come in useful for when taking website notes, using the
@samp{roam-ref} protocol (see @ref{Roam Protocol}).

Alternatively, add a ref for notes for a specific paper, using its
@uref{https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref, org-ref} citation key:

@example
#+TITLE: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
#+ROAM_KEY: cite:chen18_neural_ordin_differ_equat
@end example

The backlinks buffer will show any cites of this key: e.g.

@float Figure
@image{images/org-ref-citelink,,,,png}
@caption{org-ref-citelink}
@end float

@node The Templating System
@chapter The Templating System

Rather than creating blank files on @samp{org-roam-insert} and @samp{org-roam-find-file}, it
may be desirable to prefill the file with templated content. This may include:

@itemize
@item
Time of creation
@item
File it was created from
@item
Clipboard content
@item
Any other data you may want to input manually
@end itemize

This requires a complex template insertion system. Fortunately, Org ships with a
powerful one: @samp{org-capture}. However, org-capture was not designed for such use.
Org-roam abuses @samp{org-capture}, extending its syntax. To first understand how
org-roam's templating system works, it may be useful to look into basic usage of
@samp{org-capture}.

Org-roam's templates can be customized by modifying the variable
@samp{org-roam-capture-templates}.

@menu
* Template Walkthrough::
* Org-roam Template Expansion::
@end menu

@node Template Walkthrough
@section Template Walkthrough

To demonstrate the additions made to org-capture templates. Here, we walkthrough
the default template, reproduced below.

@lisp
("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
     "%?"
     :file-name "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-$@{slug@}"
     :head "#+TITLE: $@{title@}\n"
     :unnarrowed t)
@end lisp

@enumerate
@item
The template has short key @samp{"d"}. If you have only one template,
org-roam automatically chooses this template for you.
@item
The template is given a description of @samp{"default"}.
@item
@samp{plain} text is inserted. Other options include Org headings via
@samp{entry}.
@item
@samp{(function org-roam--capture-get-point)} should not be changed.
@item
@samp{"%?"} is the template inserted on each call to @samp{org-roam-capture--capture}.
This template means don't insert any content, but place the cursor
here.
@item
@samp{:file-name} is the file-name template for a new note, if it doesn't
yet exist. This creates a file at path that looks like
@samp{/path/to/org-roam-directory/20200213032037-foo.org}.
@item
@samp{:head} contains the initial template to be inserted (once only), at
the beginning of the file. Here, the title global attribute is
inserted.
@item
@samp{:unnarrowed t} tells org-capture to show the contents for the whole
file, rather than narrowing to just the entry.
@end enumerate

Other options you may want to learn about include @samp{:immediate-finish}.

@node Org-roam Template Expansion
@section Org-roam Template Expansion

Org-roam's template definitions also extend org-capture's template syntax, to
allow prefilling of strings. We have seen a glimpse of this in @ref{Template Walkthrough, , Template
Walkthrough}.

In org-roam templates, the @samp{$@{var@}} syntax allows for the expansion of
variables, stored in @samp{org-roam-capture--info}. For example, during
@samp{org-roam-insert}, the user is prompted for a title. Upon entering a
non-existent title, the @samp{title} key in @samp{org-roam-capture--info} is set to the
provided title. @samp{$@{title@}} is then expanded into the provided title during the
org-capture process. Any variables that do not contain strings, are prompted for
values using @samp{completing-read}.

After doing this expansion, the org-capture's template expansion system
is used to fill up the rest of the template. You may read up more on
this on @uref{https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion, org-capture's documentation page}.

To illustrate this dual expansion process, take for example the template string:
@samp{"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-$@{title@}"}, with the title @samp{"Foo"}. The template is first
expanded into @samp{%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-Foo}. Then org-capture expands @samp{%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>}
with timestamp: e.g. @samp{20200213032037-Foo}.

All of the flexibility afforded by Emacs and Org-mode are available. For
example, if you want to encode a UTC timestamp in the filename, you can take
advantage of org-mode's @samp{%(EXP)} template expansion to call @samp{format-time-string}
directly to provide its third argument to specify UTC@.

@lisp
("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
     "%?"
     :file-name "%(format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%SZ--$@{slug@}\" (current-time) t)"
     :head "#+TITLE: $@{title@}\n"
     :unnarrowed t)
@end lisp

@node Concepts and Configuration
@chapter Concepts and Configuration

The number of configuration options is deliberately kept small, to keep
the Org-roam codebase manageable. However, we attempt to accommodate as
many usage styles as possible.

All of Org-roam's customization options can be viewed via
@samp{M-x customize-group org-roam}.

@item
User Option: org-roam-buffer-no-delete-window

The @samp{no-delete-window} parameter for the org-roam buffer. Setting it to @samp{'t} prevents the window from being deleted when calling @samp{delete-other-windows}.
@end itemize

@node Org-roam Links
@section Org-roam Links

Org-roam links are regular @samp{file:} links in Org-mode. By default, links are
inserted with the title as the link description with @samp{org-roam-insert}.

@itemize
@item
User Option: org-roam-link-title-format

To distinguish between org-roam links and regular links, one may choose to use
special indicators for Org-roam links. Defaults to @samp{"%s"}.

If your version of Org is at least @samp{9.2}, consider styling the link differently,
by customizing the @samp{org-roam-link}, and @samp{org-roam-link-current} faces.
@end itemize

@node Org-roam Files
@section Org-roam Files

Org-roam files are created and prefilled using Org-roam's templating
system. The templating system is customizable (see @ref{The Templating System}).

@node Navigating Around

@node Index File
@section Index File

As your collection grows, you might want to create an index where you keep links
to your main files.

In Org-roam, you can define the path to your index file by setting
@samp{org-roam-index-file}.

@itemize
@item
Variable: org-roam-index-file

Path to the Org-roam index file.

The path can be a string or a function. If it is a string, it should be the
path (absolute or relative to @samp{org-roam-directory}) to the index file. If it
is is a function, the function should return the path to the index file.
Otherwise, the index is assumed to be a note in @samp{org-roam-index} whose
title is @samp{"Index"}.

@item
Function: org-roam-find-index

Opens the Index file in the current @samp{org-roam-directory}.
@end itemize

@node Encryption
@chapter Encryption

One may wish to keep private, encrypted files. Org-roam supports encryption (via
GPG), which can be enabled for all new files by setting @samp{org-roam-encrypt-files}
to @samp{t}. When enabled, new files are created with the @samp{.org.gpg} extension and
decryption are handled automatically by EasyPG@.

Note that Emacs will prompt for a password for encrypted files during
cache updates if it requires reading the encrypted file. To reduce the
number of password prompts, you may wish to cache the password.

@itemize
@item
Variable: org-roam-encrypt-files

Whether to encrypt new files.  If true, create files with .org.gpg extension.
@end itemize

@node Graphing
@chapter Graphing

Org-roam provides graphing capabilities to explore interconnections between
notes. This is done by performing SQL queries and generating images using
@uref{https://graphviz.org/, Graphviz}. The graph can also be navigated: see @ref{Roam Protocol}.

The entry point to graph creation is @samp{org-roam-graph}.

@itemize
@item
Function: org-roam-graph & optional arg file node-query

Build and possibly display a graph for FILE from NODE-QUERY@.
If FILE is nil, default to current buffer’s file name.
ARG may be any of the following values:

@itemize
@item
@samp{nil}       show the graph.
@item
@samp{C-u}       show the graph for FILE@.
@item
@samp{C-u N}     show the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.
@item
@samp{C-u C-u}   build the graph.
@item
@samp{C-u -}     build the graph for FILE@.

@samp{C-u -N}    build the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.
@end itemize

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-executable

Path to the graphing executable (in this case, Graphviz). Set this if Org-roam is unable to find the Graphviz executable on your system.

You may also choose to use @samp{neato} in place of @samp{dot}, which generates a more
compact graph layout.

@item
User Option: org-roam-graph-viewer

Org-roam defaults to using Firefox (located on PATH) to view the SVG, but you may choose to set it to:

@end lisp

Other options include @samp{'ido}, and @samp{'ivy}.

@node Roam Protocol
@chapter Roam Protocol

Org-roam extending @samp{org-protocol} with 2 protocols: the @samp{roam-file}
and @samp{roam-ref} protocol.

@section Installation

To enable Org-roam's protocol extensions, you have to add the following to your init file:

@lisp
(require 'org-roam-protocol)
@end lisp

The instructions for setting up @samp{org-protocol=} are reproduced below.

We will also need to create a desktop application for @samp{emacsclient}. The
instructions for various platforms are shown below.

For Linux users, create a desktop application in @samp{~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop}:

@example
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Org-Protocol
Exec=emacsclient %u
Icon=emacs-icon
Type=Application
Terminal=false
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
@end example

Associate @samp{org-protocol://} links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

@example
xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
@end example

To disable the ``confirm'' prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the @samp{Org-Protocol Client} app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

@example
sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
@{
  "ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox": true
@}
EOF
sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json
@end example

and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to <chrome://restart>) to
make the new policy take effect.

See @uref{https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start, here} for more info on the @samp{/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed} directory and
@uref{https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox, here} for information on the @samp{ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox} policy.

For MacOS, one solution is to use @uref{https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus, Platypus}. Here are the instructions for
setting up with Platypus and Chrome:

@enumerate
@item
Install and launch Platypus (with @uref{https://brew.sh/, Homebrew}):

@end example


Inside @samp{Settings}:

@example
| Setting                        | Value          |
|--------------------------------+----------------|
| Accept dropped files           | true           |
| Register as URI scheme handler | true           |
| Protocol                       | "org-protocol" |
@end example

To disable the ``confirm'' prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the @samp{OrgProtocol} app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

@example
defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true
@end example


If you're using @uref{https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport, Emacs Mac Port}, it registered its `Emacs.app` as the default
handler for the URL scheme `org-protocol`. To make @samp{OrgProtocol.app}
the default handler instead, run:

@example
defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
'@{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = @{ "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; @}; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";@}'
@end example

Then restart your computer.

@node The @samp{roam-file} protocol
@section The @samp{roam-file} protocol

This is a simple protocol that opens the path specified by the @samp{file}
key (e.g. @samp{org-protocol://roam-file?file=/tmp/file.org}). This is used
in the generated graph.

@node The @samp{roam-ref} Protocol
@section The @samp{roam-ref} Protocol

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given @samp{ROAM_KEY} (see @ref{Anatomy of an Org-roam File}):

@image{images/roam-ref,,,,gif}

To use this, create a Firefox bookmarklet as follows:

@example
javascript:location.href =
'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
+ encodeURIComponent(location.href)
+ '&title='
+ encodeURIComponent(document.title)
@end example

or as a keybinding in @samp{qutebrowser}, adding the following to the @samp{autoconfig.yml} file:

@example
settings:
  bindings.commands:
    global:
      normal:
        gc: open javascript:void(location.href='org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title))
@end example

where @samp{template} is the template key for a template in
@samp{org-roam-capture-ref-templates} (see @ref{The Templating System}). These templates
should contain a @samp{#+ROAM_KEY: $@{ref@}} in it.

@node Diagnosing and Repairing Files
@chapter Diagnosing and Repairing Files

Org-roam provides a utility for diagnosing and repairing problematic files via
@samp{org-roam-doctor}. By default, @samp{org-roam-doctor} runs the check across all Org-roam
files, and this can take some time. To run the check only for the current file,
run @samp{C-u M-x org-roam-doctor}.

@itemize
@item
Function: org-roam-doctor &optional this-buffer

Perform a check on Org-roam files to ensure cleanliness. If THIS-BUFFER, run
the check only for the current buffer.
@end itemize

The checks run are defined in @samp{org-roam-doctor--checkers}. Each checker is an instance of @samp{org-roam-doctor-checker}. To define a checker, use @samp{make-org-roam-doctor-checker}. Here is a sample definition:

@lisp
(make-org-roam-doctor-checker
    :name 'org-roam-doctor-broken-links
    :description "Fix broken links."
    :actions '(("d" . ("Unlink" . org-roam-doctor--remove-link))
               ("r" . ("Replace link" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link))
               ("R" . ("Replace link (keep label)" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link-keep-label))))
@end lisp

The @samp{:name} property is the name of the function run. The function takes in the
Org parse tree, and returns a list of @samp{(point error-message)}. @samp{:description} is a
short description of what the checker does. @samp{:actions} is an alist containing
elements of the form @samp{(char . (prompt . function))}. These actions are defined per
checker, to perform autofixes for the errors. For each error detected,
@samp{org-roam-doctor} will move the point to the current error, and pop-up a help
window displaying the error message, as well as the list of actions that can be
taken provided in @samp{:actions}.

A number of packages work well combined with Org-Roam:

@menu
* Deft::
* Org-journal::
* Note-taking Add-ons::
@end menu

@node Deft
@subsection Deft

@uref{https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/, Deft} provides a nice interface
for browsing and filtering org-roam notes.

@lisp
(use-package deft
  :after org
  :bind
  ("C-c n d" . deft)
  :custom
  (deft-recursive t)
  (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
  (deft-default-extension "org")
  (deft-directory "/path/to/org-roam-files/"))
@end lisp

If the title of the Org file is not the first line, you might not get
nice titles. You may choose to patch this to use @samp{org-roam}'s
functionality. Here I'm using
@uref{https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch, el-patch}:

@lisp
(use-package el-patch
  :straight (:host github
                   :repo "raxod502/el-patch"
                   :branch "develop"))

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'el-patch))

(use-package deft
  ;; same as above...
  :config/el-patch
  (defun deft-parse-title (file contents)
    "Parse the given FILE and CONTENTS and determine the title.
If `deft-use-filename-as-title' is nil, the title is taken to
be the first non-empty line of the FILE.  Else the base name of the FILE is
used as title."
    (el-patch-swap (if deft-use-filename-as-title
                       (deft-base-filename file)
                     (let ((begin (string-match "^.+$" contents)))
                       (if begin
                           (funcall deft-parse-title-function
                                    (substring contents begin (match-end 0))))))
                   (org-roam--get-title-or-slug file))))
@end lisp

The Deft interface can slow down quickly when the number of files get
huge. @uref{https://github.com/hasu/notdeft, Notdeft} is a fork of Deft
that uses an external search engine and indexer.

@node Org-journal
@subsection Org-journal

@uref{https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal, Org-journal} is a more
powerful alternative to the simple function @samp{org-roam-dailies-today}. It
provides better journaling capabilities, and a nice calendar interface
to see all dated entries.

@lisp
(use-package org-journal
  :bind
  ("C-c n j" . org-journal-new-entry)
  :custom
  (org-journal-date-prefix "#+TITLE: ")
  (org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org")
  (org-journal-dir "/path/to/org-roam-files/")
  (org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y"))
@end lisp

@node Note-taking Add-ons
@subsection Note-taking Add-ons

These are some plugins that make note-taking in Org-mode more enjoyable.

@end lisp

@node Org-noter / Interleave
@unnumberedsubsubsec Org-noter / Interleave

@uref{https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter, Org-noter} and
@uref{https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave, Interleave} are both
projects that allow synchronised annotation of documents (PDF, EPUB
etc.) within Org-mode.

@node Bibliography
@unnumberedsubsubsec Bibliography

@uref{https://github.com/zaeph/org-roam-bibtex, org-roam-bibtex} offers
tight integration between
@uref{https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref, org-ref},
@uref{https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex, helm-bibtex} and
@samp{org-roam}. This helps you manage your bibliographic notes under
@samp{org-roam}.

@node Spaced Repetition
@unnumberedsubsubsec Spaced Repetition

@uref{https://github.com/l3kn/org-fc/, Org-fc} is a spaced repetition
system that scales well with a large number of files. Other alternatives
include
@uref{https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html, org-drill}, and
@uref{https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam, pamparam}.

@node How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?
@section How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?

Emacs supports directory-local variables, allowing the value of
@samp{org-roam-directory} to be different in different directories. It does this by
checking for a file named @samp{.dir-locals.el}.

To add support for multiple directories, override the @samp{org-roam-directory}
variable using directory-local variables. This is what @samp{.dir-locals.el} may
contain:

@lisp
((nil . ((org-roam-directory . "/path/to/here/"))))
@end lisp

All files within that directory will be treated as their own separate
set of Org-roam files. Remember to run @samp{org-roam-db-build-cache} from a
file within that directory, at least once.
